# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Query Decomposition
Break complex objectives into clear, sequential sub-prompts.

Example: Main task: Write a report on renewable energy transitions.

Decomposed prompts:

What are the major renewable energy sources globally?

How are governments incentivizing clean energy adoption?

What challenges affect the scalability of renewables?

Once individual answers are generated, synthesize them into a cohesive report.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Decision-Making Prompts
Embed decision branches to guide the model‚Äôs structure or tone.

Example: Prompt: ‚ÄúGenerate a case study on a logistics startup adopting AI. Should the narrative be data-driven or story-based?‚Äù

This approach directs the model to self-select structure, improving alignment with creative or analytical goals.

3Ô∏è‚É£ üß© Semantic Filtering
Constrain the model‚Äôs tone, style, or domain to target a specific audience.

Example: Prompt: ‚ÄúDraft a policy brief on climate adaptation for government officials. Use formal tone and emphasize actionable insights.‚Äù

Semantic filters reduce off-topic or stylistically inconsistent results.

4Ô∏è‚É£ üé¨ Few-Shot Prompting
Train the model‚Äôs output pattern by showing examples.

Example Pattern:

text Panel 1: [Setting]
Narration: [Context]
Character A: [Dialogue] Now generate a scene featuring an inventor unveiling a time machine. Few-shot examples enhance structural consistency and genre alignment.

5Ô∏è‚É£ üß© Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage the model to reason through intermediate steps before writing.

Example: Prompt: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs reason step-by-step: define autonomous systems, explain their advantages in manufacturing, then give two realworld examples. Now consolidate into a coherent analysis.‚Äù

This leads to logically sequenced and conceptually sound writing.

6Ô∏è‚É£ üß± Constraint-Based Instruction
Apply structural or quantitative constraints to enforce discipline.

Example: Prompt: ‚ÄúCreate a 400-word academic article on neural-symbolic AI. Include an abstract, methodology, and conclusion. Follow APA style.‚Äù

Explicit constraints support reproducibility and academic rigor.

7Ô∏è‚É£ üîç Reflective Prompting
Leverage the model‚Äôs self-assessment capabilities to refine drafts.

Example: Prompt: ‚ÄúReview the following blog draft. Identify three areas for improvement in clarity or engagement, and rewrite the first paragraph accordingly.‚Äù

Reflection introduces iterative refinement and enhances output quality.


# Result :  The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
